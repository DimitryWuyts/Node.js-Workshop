## What will we be building?

Youâ€™ll be building two projects:

1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet using Node.js only.

2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Weather Stack APIs using Node.js.

3. Refactoring Weather application using Express and adding frontend to the app.

### What do you need as preparation?

A working version of Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/ for Windows/macOS)
for linux use the following command in your terminal : sudo apt install nodejs
After installation check for version : node-v
A working editor (Visual Studio, Phpstorm, Webstorm or anything that works).
If you are on windows make sure you have something like git bash to have a working terminal.
