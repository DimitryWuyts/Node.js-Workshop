![Node](https://i0.wp.com/projectsplaza.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/create-simple-static-website-with-nodejs-express.png?fit=1100%2C400)

## What is the workshop about?

We will cover the fundamentals of Node.js before diving deep into great tools like Express.

## What will we be building?

Youâ€™ll be building three projects:

1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet using Node.js only.

2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Weather Stack APIs using Node.js.

3. Refactoring Weather application using Express and adding frontend to the app.

## What do you need for the workshop?

* Install **Node.js** (you might have it already) If not, [click here to install it for Windows & macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Ubuntu: use the following command in your terminal: `sudo apt install nodejs`. Then check version with `node -v`
    
    If your `node -v` is less than `12`, then upgrade it by using: `sudo npm install n -g` and then `sudo n stable`.

* A working editor (Visual Studio, WebStorm, PhpStorm or anything that works).
If you are on windows make sure you have something like git bash to have a working terminal.

* Other packages will be installed during the workshop when needed.
